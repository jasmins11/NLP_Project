Symptoms: - swelling – the low level of protein in the blood reduces the flow of water from body tissues back into the blood vessels, leading to swelling(oedema). Swelling is usually first noticed around the eyes, then around the lower legs and the rest of the body. - infections – antibodies are a specialised group of proteins in the blood that help to fight infection. When these are lost, children are much more likely to get infections. - urine changes – occasionally, the high levels of protein being passed into the urine can cause it to become frothy. Some children with nephrotic syndrome may also pass less urine than usual during relapses. - blood clots – important proteins that help prevent the blood clotting can be passed out in the urine of children with nephrotic syndrome. This can increase their risk of potentially seriousblood clots. During a relapse, the blood also becomes more concentrated, which can lead to clotting.","- swelling – the low level of protein in the blood reduces the flow of water from body tissues back into the blood vessels, leading to swelling(oedema).
