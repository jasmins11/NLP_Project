    "symptoms": "Different types of dementia can affect people differently, and everyone will experience symptoms in their own way.\nHowever, there are some common early symptoms that may appear some time before a diagnosis of dementia. These include:\n- memory loss\n- difficulty concentrating\n- finding it hard to carry out familiar daily tasks, such as getting confused over the correct change when shopping\n- struggling to follow a conversation or find the right word\n- being confused about time and place\n- mood changes\nThese symptoms are often mild and may get worse only very gradually. It's often termed \"mild cognitive impairment\" (MCI) as the symptoms are not severe enough to be diagnosed as dementia.\nYou might not notice these symptoms if you have them, and family and friends may not notice or take them seriously for some time. In some people, these symptoms will remain the same and not worsen. But some people with MCI will go on to develop dementia.\nDementia is not a natural part of ageing. This is why it's important to talk to a GP sooner rather than later if you're worried about memory problems or other symptoms."
