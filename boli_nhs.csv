      Bone cancer","Primary bone cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the bones. Around 550 new cases are diagnosed each year in the UK.
This is a separate condition from secondary bone cancer, which is cancer that spreads to the bones after developing in another part of the body.","Bone cancer can affect any bone, but most cases develop in the long bones of the legs or upper arms.
The main symptoms include:
- persistent bone pain that gets worse over time and continues into the night
- swelling and redness (inflammation) over a bone, which can make movement difficult if the affected bone is near a joint
- a noticeable lump over a bone
- a weak bone that breaks (fractures) more easily than normal
- problems moving around – for example, walking with a limp
If you or your child are experiencing persistent, severe or worsening bone pain, visit your GP.
While it's highly unlikely to be the result of bone cancer, it does require further investigation.

Botulism,"Botulism is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria.
These toxins attack the nervous system (nerves, brain and spinal cord) and causeparalysis(muscle weakness).","The time it takes to develop symptoms can vary from a few hours to several days after exposure to the Clostridium botulinum bacteria or their toxins.
Depending on the exact type of botulism, some people initially have symptoms such as feeling sick, being sick (vomiting), stomach cramps,diarrhoeaorconstipation.
Without treatment, botulism eventually causes paralysis that spreads down the body from the head to the legs.
Symptoms can include:
- drooping eyelids

- slurred speech
- breathing difficulties

Bowen's disease,"Bowen's disease is a very early form of skin cancer that's easily treatable. The main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin.

Some people have more than 1 patch.
The patch may be:
- scaly or crusty
- flat or raised
- up to a few centimetres across
- itchy (but not all the time)
- red or pink on white skin, but this may be harder to see on brown and black skin
The patch can appear anywhere on the skin, but is especially common on exposed areas like the lower legs, neck and head.
Sometimes they can affect the groin area and, in men, the penis.
If the patch bleeds, starts to turn into an open sore (ulcer) or develops a lump, it could be a sign it's turned into squamous cell skin cancer."

      Childhood cataracts","Cataracts occur when changes in the lens of the eye cause it to become less transparent (clear). This results in cloudy or misty vision.
The lens is the transparent structure located just behind the pupil (the black circle in the centre of the eye).","In children, cataracts can affect 1 or both eyes.
Cloudy patches in the lens can sometimes get bigger and more can develop, resulting in the child's vision becoming increasingly affected.
As well as poor vision, cataracts can also cause ""wobbling eyes"" and asquint, where the eyes point in different directions.
When your child is very young, it can be difficult to spot signs of cataracts.
But your baby's eyes will be routinely examined at their newborn physical screening examination within 72 hours of birth, and again when they're 6 to 8 weeks old.
If a congenital cataract is suspected at the newborn examination, a specialist eye doctor will see your baby within 2 weeks of the examination.
If a congenital cataract is suspected at the 6 to 8 week examination, a specialist eye doctor will see your baby by the time they're 11 weeks old.
Sometimes cataracts can develop in children after these screening tests.
It's particularly important to spot cataracts in children quickly because early treatment can reduce the risk of long-term vision problems.
You should visit a GP or tell your health visitor if you have any concerns about your child's eyesight.

The severity and duration of symptoms can vary depending on the size, location and number of cavernomas.
Problems can occur if the cavernoma bleeds or presses on certain areas of the brain.
The cells lining a cavernoma are often thinner than those that line normal blood vessels, which means they're prone to leaking blood.
In most cases, bleeding is small – usually around half a teaspoonful of blood – and may not cause other symptoms.
But severe haemorrhages can be life threatening and may lead to long-lasting problems.
